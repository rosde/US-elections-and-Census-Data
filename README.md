Every four years, US citizens exercise their civic rights through presidential elections. Unlike many nations worldwide, which use direct elections based on the national popular vote ('one person, one vote') to elect their respective presidents, the United States presidential system utilizes indirect elections through the Electoral College. This decentralized system mirrors the structure of other elections in the United States, where each state plays a significant role in the electoral process (NCSL, 2023).

In light of the influential role played by each state and the potential for demographic shifts within a four-year time frame, we employ available data to explore voting trends across individual states alongside demographic changes, with a particular emphasis on race and ethnicity. Two primary questions guide our analysis:

How have party preferences evolved over time across different geographic regions of the United States?
What impact do changes in demographic trends wield on election outcomes within specific states?


We rely on data from the MIT Election Data Science Lab to address these inquiries. Additionally, we utilize publicly available US census data, accessed via the tidycensus R package.
